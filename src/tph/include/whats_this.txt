The files contained here are tpa files that DEFINE one or more general-purpose
MACROS and/or FUNCTIONS. These files are included before installing each
component, so make sure they don't set stray variables and/or do other,
non-DEFINE actions. As a general guideline, for any of your MACROs, there
should be an equally named FUNCTION that does the same thing (eventually as a
wrapper). However, you're free to develop stuff as only FUNCTION and/or MACRO
if it makes sense to do so.
Name your files <author prefix>macros.tpa and/or <author prefix>functions.tpa.
