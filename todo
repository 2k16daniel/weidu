Vastly out-of-date to-do list of things I'll never get to:

allow_missing should cover all of the "COPY_TRANS out of range" errors
edit 2da entry (rol, col, new_val)

allow people to specify their tp2 language on the command line
--automate CRE sounds

allow copying (but no patches) big files

update docs to reflect chain3/interject/interject_copy trans powers:
  DO actions allowed, chain can end in exit or copy_trans, initial
  conditions
