WeiDU regression tests:

auto-test/dialogu-test.sh
        Extracts about 2700 DLG files from Dialog.Bif, converts them all to
        D files, reads those D files in and creates DLG files, reads those
        in to create D files, and then compares the two sets of D files. 

good-syntax/*.D
        Test of various syntax formulations. All should compile correctly
        and generate DLG Files. However, these DLG files are probably
        non-sensical. WARNING: Do not use them in a running game.

bad-syntax/*.D
        All of these files should have syntax errors.

no-game/*.D
        Small tests that work even if you don't have any Infinity Engine
        games. 

quitch/*.TP2
        A small test made to demonstrate a bug that Quitch reported.
