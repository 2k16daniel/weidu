This is a set of automated tests for --traify and --traify-old-tra.

To run this, you need to move the files into a IE game directory and
run run_tests.pl. test.tp2 and test.tra are used by the tests, so make
sure they're not something you want to keep.

Caveat programmer: I got lazy and resorted to MD5 checksums instead of
attempting to parse the files, so if you want to extend the tests, you
either need to be less lazy than I am now, or update the perl script
with new sums.

traifyold.test.tp2 is the traified traify.test.tp2 extended with
untraified strings. traifyold.test.tra is the result of --traify on
traify.test.tp2.
